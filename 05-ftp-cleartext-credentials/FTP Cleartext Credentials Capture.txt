# 🔐 FTP Cleartext Credentials Capture using Wireshark

This section focuses on capturing and analyzing **FTP (File Transfer Protocol) cleartext credentials** using Wireshark. FTP is a protocol used to transfer files over a network, and when unencrypted, it transmits sensitive data like login credentials in cleartext.

## 📖 What is FTP Cleartext?

**FTP cleartext** refers to the transmission of data (including login credentials) over FTP without any encryption. In such cases, usernames and passwords are sent in plain text, making them vulnerable to interception by attackers monitoring the network.

## ⚙️ How It Was Implemented

1. ✅ Started Wireshark capture on the **Wi-Fi** or **Ethernet** interface.
2. ✅ Opened **Command Prompt** and connected to a public FTP test server using:
ftp ftp://test.rebex.net

3. ✅ Logged in using the credentials:
- **Username**: `demo`
- **Password**: `password`

4. ✅ Performed a basic FTP interaction and then exited.
5. ✅ Stopped the Wireshark capture.
6. ✅ Applied the filter:
ftp.request.command == "USER" || ftp.request.command == "PASS"


7. ✅ Observed and analyzed the captured FTP packets showing cleartext credentials.
