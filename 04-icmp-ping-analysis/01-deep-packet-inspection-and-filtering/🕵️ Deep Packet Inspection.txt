# 🔎 Packet Inspection & Protocol Filtering with Wireshark

This section combines two powerful features of Wireshark: **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)** and **Protocol Filtering**. These features allow network analysts to capture, filter, and analyze specific protocol traffic and inspect the payload data at a detailed level.

## 📁 Overview

| Feature                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Protocol Filtering     | Isolate and study traffic by specific protocols (HTTP, DNS, ICMP, FTP, etc.)|
| Deep Packet Inspection | Inspect actual payload content in readable form, especially for unencrypted data|

## ⚙️ How It Was Implemented

1. ✅ Started live capture on the active network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet).
2. ✅ Generated specific protocol traffic (e.g., browsed websites, pinged IPs, FTP login).
3. ✅ Applied protocol-specific filters such as:
   - `http` – to view HTTP requests/responses
   - `dns` – to analyze DNS queries and replies
   - `icmp` – to monitor ping messages
   - `ftp` – to capture FTP login and commands
   - `arp` – to inspect IP-to-MAC resolution traffic
   - `tls` – to view TLS handshake and encrypted sessions
4. ✅ Used **Packet Details** and **Packet Bytes** panes to inspect payloads and headers.
5. ✅ Used `tcp contains "GET"` and other content filters to demonstrate DPI.

| Protocol | Use Case                             | What Was Observed                                           |
|----------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| HTTP     | Browsing websites                    | GET and POST requests in plaintext                          |
| DNS      | Resolving domain names               | Queries and corresponding IP responses                      |
| ICMP     | Sending ping packets                 | Echo Request and Echo Reply messages                        |
| ARP      | IP-MAC address resolution            | Who-Has and Is-At messages                                  |
| FTP      | Logging into FTP                     | USER and PASS commands in plaintext                         |
| TLS      | Secure HTTPS connections             | TLS handshake initiation and encrypted packets              |
| TCP      | DPI on payloads                      | Filters like `tcp contains "GET"` showed HTTP commands      |
