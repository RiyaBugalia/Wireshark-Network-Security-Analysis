# 📘 ICMP Ping Analysis with Wireshark

## 🧪 Overview

This experiment captures and analyzes ICMP packets using Wireshark to understand the structure and behavior of ping (echo) requests and replies. The analysis demonstrates how ICMP operates in network diagnostics, specifically through the use of the `ping` command to test connectivity with Google's DNS.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Wireshark (latest version)
- Command Prompt (Windows 11)
- Ping Command:
  ping www.google.com
- No video recording was performed; only screenshots were used.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Observe and filter ICMP Echo Request and Reply packets.
- Analyze key ICMP packet fields such as Type, Code, Identifier, and Sequence Number.
- Identify source and destination IP addresses of the packets.

## 🔧 Procedure

1. Start Wireshark and select the active network interface (usually Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
2. In Command Prompt, type:
   ping www.google.com
3. In Wireshark, apply the filter:
   icmp
4. Capture packets during the ping.
5. Analyze the details of the Echo Request (Type 8) and Echo Reply (Type 0) packets.

## 🧾 Key Packet Details

### ICMP Echo Request:
- Type: 8 (Echo Request)
- Code: 0
- Identifier & Sequence Number: Help track request/response matching
- Source IP: Local system (e.g., 192.168.x.x)
- Destination IP: www.google.com (e.g., 142.250.x.x)

### ICMP Echo Reply:
- Type: 0 (Echo Reply)
- Code: 0
- Returns same ID and Sequence Number as request

## ✅ Outcome

- Successfully captured and filtered ICMP traffic related to a ping operation.
- Verified correct structure of ICMP packets and their role in diagnostics.
- Identified matching Echo Requests and Replies with correct identifiers.

✅ Conclusion
ICMP is a fundamental part of IP-based networking, and using Wireshark to analyze ping traffic offers insight into packet flow, host reachability, and network latency. The hands-on ping analysis highlights how Echo Requests and Replies function within real-time communication and diagnostics.
