# 🌐 TCP Stream Analysis using Wireshark

This section demonstrates how to analyze **TCP streams** in Wireshark. TCP streams represent end-to-end connections where data is exchanged, such as opening a website or transferring files.

## 📖 What is a TCP Stream?

A **TCP stream** is the complete conversation (bi-directional flow) between a client and a server over the **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**. Each stream is made up of segments or packets that Wireshark can follow and reassemble into readable content like HTML, FTP commands, or HTTP requests.

## ⚙️ How It Was Implemented

1. ✅ Started capture in Wireshark on the active interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet).
2. ✅ Opened a website in a browser (e.g., `https://www.wikipedia.org`).
3. ✅ Stopped the capture after the page loaded.
4. ✅ Applied the display filter:
tcp
5. ✅ Right-clicked on a packet → **Follow** → **TCP Stream**.
6. ✅ Inspected the stream in ASCII mode to view the data.
7. ✅ Checked TCP flags (SYN, ACK) and packet info.

| Element              | Explanation                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TCP SYN/ACK`        | Flags exchanged during connection setup (3-way handshake)   |
| `Sequence & ACK`     | Sequence and acknowledgment numbers used in reliable data transfer |
| `Stream Index`       | A unique number assigned to each TCP conversation           |
| `Stream Content`     | Application-layer data exchanged (HTML, credentials, etc.)  |

## ✅ Conclusion

Using Wireshark to analyze **TCP streams** helps visualize the data exchanged during a TCP connection. It reveals how the application layer (e.g., HTTP) interacts with transport layer (TCP), making it invaluable for network troubleshooting and forensic analysis.
