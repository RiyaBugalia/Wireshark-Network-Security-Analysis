# 🔐 TLS Handshake Analysis using Wireshark

This section focuses on capturing and analyzing the **TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake** using Wireshark. TLS is the cryptographic protocol that secures communication over the internet, particularly for HTTPS traffic.

---

## 📖 What is TLS Handshake?

The **TLS handshake** is the process that establishes a secure connection between a client (like a browser) and a server (like a website). During the handshake:

1. The client sends a `Client Hello` with supported TLS versions and cipher suites.
2. The server responds with a `Server Hello`, selecting parameters and providing a digital certificate.
3. Both parties exchange and agree upon session keys.
4. Change Cipher Spec messages are sent to initiate encrypted communication.

## ⚙️ How It Was Implemented

1. ✅ Wireshark capture started on the **Wi-Fi** interface.
2. ✅ Visited `https://www.wikipedia.org` in a web browser.
3. ✅ Captured the packets during the TLS handshake process.
4. ✅ Applied filter: `tls.handshake`
5. ✅ Inspected individual handshake packets, focusing on:
   - `Client Hello`
   - `Server Hello`
   - `Change Cipher Spec` messages from both client and server
   - Extra TLS handshake details from the **TLS protocol label** within Wireshark

## ✅ Conclusion

Wireshark allows for deep packet inspection of the **TLS handshake**, providing insight into how encrypted sessions are negotiated. This is valuable for troubleshooting certificate issues, understanding TLS version use, and ensuring secure configurations on networks.
