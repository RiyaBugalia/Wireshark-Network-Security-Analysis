# 🌐 DNS Analysis with Wireshark

## 🧪 Overview

This section focuses on capturing and analyzing **DNS (Domain Name System)** packets using Wireshark. DNS is a foundational network protocol that resolves human-readable domain names (like `www.bing.com`) into machine-understandable IP addresses.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Wireshark (latest version)
- Windows 11 Command Prompt
- DNS Query Site: www.bing.com
- Command: `ping www.bing.com`
- DNS activity automatically precedes the ICMP ping
- A video demonstration of DNS filtering is included

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Capture DNS request and response packets.
- Filter out only DNS traffic using the Wireshark filter pane.
- Analyze packet structure, including query and response details.
- Identify source and destination IPs for DNS packets.

## 🔧 Procedure

1. Launched Wireshark and selected the active network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet).
2. Started packet capture.
3. Opened Command Prompt and executed: `ping www.bing.com`
4. Observed the DNS query initiated before the ICMP ping.
5. Applied Wireshark filter:
dns
6. Examined the DNS query and response to `www.bing.com`.

## 🧾 DNS Packet Details

### DNS Query Packet:
- **Transaction ID**: Random identifier
- **Flags**: Standard query
- **Questions**: 1
- **Query Name**: `www.bing.com`
- **Query Type**: A (IPv4 address)
- **Source IP**: Client (your machine)
- **Destination IP**: DNS server (like 8.8.8.8)

### DNS Response Packet:
- **Transaction ID**: Matches the query
- **Answers**: Contains IP address(es) of `www.bing.com`
- **TTL**: How long to cache the result
- **Type**: A (IPv4 address)

## 🎥 Video Demonstration

**File:** `dns_filter_demo.mp4`

Covers:
- Capturing traffic with Wireshark
- Using the `dns` filter
- Exploring DNS query and response for `www.bing.com`

## ✅ Conclusion

This DNS analysis highlights how a simple command like `ping www.bing.com` initiates background DNS resolution. Using Wireshark, we gain clear insight into the client-server query exchange and IP resolution before any actual data is transmitted.
